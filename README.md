# Implementation and research of the application of the genetic algorithm in clustering

The goal is to create an information system for clustering three-dimensional data.

The explanatory note of the course work shows the implementation of the following stages:

1. Description of the problem of clustering planes
2. Implementation of a prototype of an information system that uses a genetic algorithm to solve a simplified problem
3. Implementation of information system prototypes using other machine learning algorithms to solve similar problems
4. Comparison of the efficiency of the created prototypes, determination of the necessity of using the genetic algorithm
5. Preparing a real dataset
6. Configuration and refinement of the prototype created at the first stage to ensure effective work with the prepared dataset
